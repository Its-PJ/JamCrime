# JamCrime
This is an excercise in cleaning and visualizing data

The JamCrime ipynb takes the 'jamcrime.csv' file and outputs a cleaned csv file. 


The cleaned csv file (which has already been uploaded for convenience) is the initial file when running the 'Visualized Jam Crimes' pything notebook

The 'Visualized Jam Crimes' notebook is still a work in progress.
